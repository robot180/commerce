This was the 2nd project for CS50W.
I primarily focused on the backend using Django.
A new user can register and then create a new listing, bid on an existing listng, and close his/her own listing.
Active auctions can be seen on the main page and they can be filter by category.
A user add and view comments for each listing and add a listing to his/her own watchlist.
